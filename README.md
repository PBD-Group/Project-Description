## Need of Sentiment Analysis?

<p>Nearly 80% of the world’s digital data is unstructured, and data obtained from social media sources is no exception to that. Since the information is not organized in any predefined way, it’s difficult to sort and analyze. Fortunately, thanks to the developments in Machine Learning and analytic techniques, it is now possible to create models that learn from examples and can be used to process and organize text data.</p>

<p>Twitter sentiment analysis systems allow you to sort large sets of tweets and detect the polarity of each statement automatically. And the best part, it’s fast and simple, saving teams valuable hours and allowing them to focus on tasks where they can make a bigger impact.</p>
